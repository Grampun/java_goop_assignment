# Java Graphical Object Oriented Assignment

I had the opportunity to build a computer fault report system created using Java as part of my studies.

Attached one will find all the source code, as well as the user manual for it.

## The system contains:
<ul>
  <li>Easy to use & understand UI</li>
  <li>Choose lab and computers containing faults</li>
  <li>A report form will be updated depending on the chosen machines</li>
  <li>Ability to send an email of the report to the desired email address (meant for the IT administrator of the school</li>
</ul>
